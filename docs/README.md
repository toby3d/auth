> Personal [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.net/source/) server.

An attempt to implement my own server to authenticate and authorize third-party applications through [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) sites on [Go](https://go.dev/). Based on the latest versions of the protocol standards and related batteries like [TicketAuth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth_Ticket_Auth) and [RelMeAuth](https://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth).
